# ManualNN
Manual Neural Net

This project is inspired by this website http://playground.tensorflow.org

You can set all values of the Neurons (Weights and Bias) and see what each neuron does.
The first view shows the output of the final output neuron. is the same as the last sqare on the top right. The configured net consist of two hidden layers with each having two neurons and one output neuron. Therefore you can adjust with the sliders each neuron with its two inputs and bias.

Planned Features:
- training algorithms
- visualizing neurons and weights
